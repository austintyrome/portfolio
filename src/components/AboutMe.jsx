              </div>
             <p>My name is Austin Godfrey. I am looking to make a career change into web development. I have worked in the medical field for the last 4 years medical assisting and before that I was a manger at Dairy Queen. A cornerstone of who I am is my friendliness and approachability. I believe in creating a welcoming environment where colleagues and clients feel valued and understood. My ability to build rapport quickly has helped me establish strong professional relationships, enhance team cohesion, and improve client satisfaction. My leadership style is collaborative and inclusive, empowering team members to contribute their best while fostering a culture of mutual respect and shared success. Problem-solving is one of my strongest attributes. I approach challenges with a solution-oriented mindset. In today's fast-paced work environment, the ability to multitask is crucial. I have honed this skill through years of managing multiple projects simultaneously, ensuring that each task receives the attention it deserves. The ability to adapt to changing circumstances is essential in any professional setting. I pride myself on my flexibility and resilience, readily adjusting to new situations, technologies, and environments. A strong work ethic underpins all my professional endeavors. I am committed to delivering high-quality work, consistently meeting or exceeding expectations. Effective communication is the glue that binds all my skills together. Whether it's conveying complex ideas clearly, listening actively to understand others, or providing constructive feedback, my communication skills are second to none.</p>
