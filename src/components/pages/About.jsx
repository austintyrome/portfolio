        Hello my name is Austin Godfrey. I am a jr. developer for both front and back end. Languages and programs I have learned and used include: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, MongoDb, Insomnia, React, GitHub, Express.js, and SQL. I enjoy reading, video games, and spending time with my dogs. When problem solving I like taking the problem apart in parts and work on it part by part rubber ducking my way through it until I come to a spot where I need to use other resources.
